# Tux Mind Maths Draft

### Introduction
Tux mind maths is a collection of games ment to provide productive diversions to children. Mind maths would try to educate children about the teachniques from vedic mathamtics and the same time entertain them.

### Development Stack 
Mind maths would be primerely built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Both web and hybrid mobile applications will be awailable at the same time, making it easier for people to use it across platforms. Building application in any of iOs, Android or Windows phone platform would not allow such flexiblity.

### Design desipline
The design of Tux Mind Math would be inspired from material design with cartonized figures, much similar to santatracker.google.com .

### Games
###### Philosophy
Most learning oriented games do not provide actull gaming expirence. Games which provide real gaming expireance along with the leaning tend to be more engrossing and hence effective, Tux Math Command is a fine example. Different techniques in vadic mathamtics have different complexity, for example multiplication with 11 could be done in flash of a second while something like a genralized multiplication would take considerable time. Considering above fact the following games are planned.
###### Duck Hunt Alike
A game like Duck Hunt can be helpful with simplest questions. The player would have to aim for the duck/saucer with the correct solution for the equation flased.
###### Pacman
This is suitable for problems slighty difficult than the duck hunt.
###### Biliards/Pool
This would be ment for difficult problems, the gameplay being slow everyone would get enough time to solve.
###### More
4/5 more games would be added based on similar concept.

### Progress
Currently the pacman game has been developed, the design for the same is in progress. The questions and documentation are incomplete.
