# Tux Mind Maths Draft

### Introduction
Tux mind maths is a collection of games meant to provide productive diversions to children. Mind maths would try to educate children about the techniques from Vedic mathematics and at the same time entertain them.

### Development Stack 
Mind maths would be primarily built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Both web and hybrid mobile applications will be available at the same time, making it easier for people to use it across platforms. Building the application in any of iOs, Android or Windows phone platforms would not allow such flexibility.

### Design Discipline
Tux Mind Math will have a cartoonized alien theme which would be appealing to the children.

### Games
###### Philosophy
Most learning oriented games do not provide actual gaming experience. Games which provide real gaming experience along with the leaning tend to be more engrossing and hence more effective (Tux Math Command is a fine example). Different techniques in Vedic mathematics have different complexity, for example multiplication with 11 could be done in flash of a second while something like a generalized multiplication would take considerable time. Considering above fact the following games are planned.The games are arranged in increasing order of required response time.
###### Fruit Ninja
A game fruit ninja can be helpful with simplest questions. The player would have to slice for the fruit with the correct solution for the equation flashed.
###### Flappy Bird
A game like flappy bird where person would have to fly through the ring with right answer.
###### Snakes 
Version of traditional snakes game, where the there would be multiple meat balls. Player has to select meat ball according to the question.
###### Pacman
This is suitable for problems slightly difficult than the duck hunt.
###### 2D temple run
Turn to the direction marking the correct answer to the equation flashed.
###### Billiards/Pool
This would be meant for difficult problems, the gameplay being slow everyone would get enough time to solve.

### Progress
Currently the pacman and snake game has been developed, the design for the same is in progress. The questions and documentation are incomplete.
